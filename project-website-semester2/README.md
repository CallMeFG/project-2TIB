## 🏨 About the Project

**CallMeHotel** is a full-stack web application developed as a final project for the **Web Programming Workshop** course. This application simulates a modern hotel reservation system, featuring a dynamic and responsive user interface for guests and a comprehensive management panel for administrators and hotel staff.

### 🎯 Project Objectives

This project demonstrates the implementation of modern web development concepts, including:

- **MVC Architecture** (Model-View-Controller)
- **Multi-role Authentication System** with role-based access control
- **CRUD Operations** for comprehensive data management
- **Relational Database** implementation with Eloquent ORM
- **Modern Asset Bundling** with Vite for optimized performance

| **👤 User** | Registered customer who can make reservations | Create reservations, View personal history, Profile management | `auth` (Laravel Default) |

---

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### Backend Technologies
- **PHP** `^8.2` - Server-side programming language
- **Laravel Framework** `^12.0` - PHP web application framework
- **MySQL** `8.0` - Primary database management system
- **Eloquent ORM** - Database interaction layer
- **Laravel Breeze** - Authentication starter kit

### Frontend Technologies
- **Vite** - Modern build tool for fast asset compilation
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework for responsive design
- **Alpine.js** - Lightweight JavaScript framework for interactivity
- **Chart.js** - Data visualization library for admin dashboard
- **Font Awesome** - Icon library for admin and staff panels

### Development Environment
- **Laragon** - Integrated local server environment (Apache/Nginx, MySQL, PHP)
- **Composer** - PHP dependency manager
- **NPM/Yarn** - Frontend package manager
- **Laravel Pint** - PHP code style fixer
- **Laravel Pail** - Interactive logging tool

---

## 🔒 Application Security

This project implements several standard web security practices provided by Laravel to protect data and users.

### 🛡️ Security Features

- **CSRF Protection (Cross-Site Request Forgery)**: All forms performing `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, or `DELETE` actions are protected by CSRF tokens using the `@csrf` Blade directive in every form.

- **Server-Side Validation**: All user-submitted data through forms (registration, contact, data creation) is strictly validated server-side using **Laravel Validator**. This prevents invalid or potentially harmful data from entering the system.

- **SQL Injection Protection**: By using Eloquent ORM and Laravel's Query Builder, all database interactions automatically use **prepared statements**, effectively preventing SQL Injection attacks.

- **Password Hashing**: User passwords are never stored as plain text. All passwords are securely hashed using **Bcrypt** during registration and updates. Password verification during login is performed against the hashed value, not plain text.

- **Route Protection with Middleware**: Sensitive routes for Admin and Staff are protected by custom middleware (`AdminMiddleware` and `StaffMiddleware`). These middleware check user roles before granting access and redirect unauthorized users.

- **Output Escaping (XSS Protection)**: Blade template engine automatically escapes all data displayed using `{{ }}` syntax by default. This helps prevent **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** attacks by ensuring no malicious scripts are executed on the client side.

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the Application

### Recommended Method (Using Development Script)

The project includes a custom script that runs all necessary services simultaneously:

```bash
composer dev
```

This command automatically starts:
- PHP development server (`php artisan serve`)
- Queue worker for background tasks (`php artisan queue:listen`)
- Real-time log monitoring (`php artisan pail`)
- Vite development server with HMR (`npm run dev`)

### Accessing the Application

Once the server is running, open your browser and visit the URL configured in your `.env` file (e.g., `http://callmehotel.test`).

### 🔑 Default Accounts

The system comes pre-seeded with test accounts for easy testing:

| Role | Email | Password |
|:-----|:------|:---------|
| 👑 **Admin** | `admin@callmehotel.test` | `password` |
| 👥 **Staff** | `staff@callmehotel.test` | `password` |
| 👤 **Customer** | `test@example.com` | `password` |

## 🗄️ Database Structure & Project Organization

### Database Schema

The database structure is defined in migration files located in `database/migrations`, with relationships managed through Eloquent ORM.

#### Core Tables
- **`users`** - User data including name, email, and role (admin/staff/user)
- **`rooms`** - Room types with pricing, descriptions, images, and quantity
- **`reservations`** - Core transaction table linking users and rooms with booking details

#### Laravel System Tables
- `sessions`, `cache`, `jobs`, `failed_jobs` - Laravel functional tables

### Entity Relationship Diagram

```mermaid

    users {
        int id PK
        string name
        string email
        string role

        string image
        int quantity
        timestamp created_at
        timestamp updated_at
    }
    reservations {
        int id PK
        int user_id FK
        int room_id FK
        date check_in_date
        date check_out_date
        string status
        timestamp created_at
        timestamp updated_at
    }
    users ||--o{ reservations : "creates"
    rooms ||--o{ reservations : "booked_for"
